# ASL

1. This repository contains the dataset, code, and outputs for the ASL project (CS 766 2024 Spring).
2. Before running the code, extract the input.rar file into the ASL directory. After extraction, you should find two folders within the ASL\input\ directory: asl-alphabet and asl-alphabet-test.
